# Koru üåø Your Second Brain, Reimagined

Koru is a personal knowledge management system designed to help you capture, connect, and rediscover your thoughts. It transforms your notes and ideas into an interactive, interconnected web, allowing you to uncover hidden patterns and insights within your own knowledge base.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interconnected Notes**: Create notes as "nodes" and form explicit links between them to build a personal knowledge graph.
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Navigate your thoughts visually with a dynamic, clickable graph interface.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Receive smart suggestions for new connections, auto-generate summaries of long notes, and search by concept rather than just keywords.
- **Voice-to-Text**: Capture fleeting thoughts by speaking directly into the app using Whisper-powered transcription.
- **Timeline View**: View your events and ideas laid out chronologically for easy reflection and planning.
- **Secure & Private**: Keep sensitive thoughts separate with a dedicated "Secret" mode, ensuring your privacy.
